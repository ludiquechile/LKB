Ludique's Kinect Bundle - Small set of Kinect utilities

Working in Ubuntu 20.04 with QT 5. Tested using the following libraries:

- OpenCV 2.4
- OpenNI 1.5.7.10
- NITE 1.5.2.23
- Sensor Kinect 

Should work in some previous ones, but has not been tested. 

You can download all the kinect libraries in the following links : 

https://fivedots.coe.psu.ac.th/~ad/kinect/installation.html
https://github.com/OpenNI/OpenNI/tree/unstable
https://github.com/avin2/SensorKinect

To get the version of OpenCV : 
https://github.com/opencv/opencv/tree/2.4.13.6

cmake
